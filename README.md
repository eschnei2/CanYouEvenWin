# CanYouEvenWin

This is a simple app that asks the question, Can you really win online sweepstakes?

In this app a user can view a contest.  From there they can add an attempt they've made on the contest.  The app will then calculate their win rate for all contests or just the one they've entered.

This is an MVC app.
To run this you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio.  I have left the table sql data and some seed data for the app in a text file that can be found in the .txt files SqlTables and SqlData.
